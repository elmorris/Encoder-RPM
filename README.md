# Encoder-RPM
Creation of a block to read the RPM of an encoder from simulink arduino

Instructions 

1 First configure the sampling time for your encoder 1/fs (time the encoder works. Example of mine 1/10 Ghz) in solver.
2 Determine the COM port where the arduino is.
3 Change the conversion values ​​within the subsystem.
4 Install the arduino library in simulink
